"""12-preset niche sequential marketing system with 3-day cycle orchestration.

Implements the DataSift niche sequential marketing workflow:
  Day 1: Text → Call → Trigger mailer
  Day 2: Call (different script) → Text variation
  Day 3: Final call → Final text → Mailer arrives

Channels escalate by cost: SMS ($0.01) → Call ($0.03-0.06) → Mail ($0.50-2.00) → Deep Prospecting ($1.50-4.00)

13 filter presets in "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" folder:
  00. Needs Skip Traced
  01. Ready to Text
  02-04. Needs Called Day 1/2/3
  05. Needs Mailed
  06. Needs Deep Prospecting
  07. Callback Scheduled
  08. Hot Lead
  09. Not Interested
  10. Bad Data
  11. Completed Cycle
  12. Pre-Probate Heir Discovery (gates pre_probate without confirmed DM out of SMS/call)

Usage:
  python src/main.py niche-sequential --list-name "Foreclosure" --channel sms --day 1
  python src/main.py niche-sequential --action setup-presets
